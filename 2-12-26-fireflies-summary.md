**Notes**

## **Customer Retention and Churn Management**

The team is focusing on reducing customer churn by improving service quality and proactive engagement to keep customers from switching to competitors.

-   **Churn Breakdown and Customer Feedback Insights**  highlighted that in early February there were  **20 disconnects**, with  **8 switching to competitors**,  **2 unsatisfied with service**,  **3 moving out of area**, and  **7 non-pay disconnects**  (12:00).
    
    -   The main churn reasons discussed were service issues and competitor offers, with emphasis on unsatisfied customers needing targeted retention efforts.
        
    -   Stanley and Brittany are tasked to analyze churn causes deeply and develop plans to reduce unsatisfied customers, aiming to cut unsatisfied disconnects roughly in half within a few months.
        
    -   Follow-up calls to customers who left due to service issues will be made within  **2-3 months**  to attempt win-backs, as some customers return after competitors’ problems.
        
-   **Monthly Customer Surveys Proposed**  as a way to identify dissatisfaction early and prevent churn (15:25).
    
    -   TJ Scott emphasized surveys with incentives like  **$100 Amazon gift cards**  to increase response rates and capture issues before customers switch providers.
        
    -   The team agreed surveys should be non-anonymous to allow targeted follow-ups.
        
    -   Coordination between Brittany and Michaela will devise outreach and survey strategies for rollout by the next meeting.
        
-   **Signal and Service Quality Monitoring**  could forecast churn risk by ranking customers by uptime and signal strength (17:41).
    
    -   Kevin Rose suggested using uptime/downtime data over 30–60 days to identify struggling customers for proactive outreach.
        
    -   The team plans to develop a game plan with Chris, Aaron, and Adam to monitor poor signals and have tech support reach out to at-risk customers before they disconnect.
        
    -   This approach aligns with tower-side preventive maintenance already done by Aaron, extending it into customer-level support.
        
-   **Toronto Network Expansion as Churn Mitigation**  to move customers off older tech and improve experience (34:14).
    
    -   There are currently  **26 customers on Toronto**, with  **5 on the office tower**  and  **21 on Hammond tower**, live since fall last year.
        
    -   Kevin Rose stressed accelerating transfers to Toronto since customers there show very low churn risk.
        
    -   By the end of February, Aaron and Chris will identify and rank  **10 sites**  for Toronto upgrades to replace older tech, improving speeds and customer retention.
        
    -   Converting all customers off the Canby tower to Toronto was discussed to reduce complaints and churn linked to Canby’s performance issues.
        

## **Service Calls and Operational Efficiency**

Service calls are decreasing partly due to fewer customers and changes in charging policies, with the team aiming for better tracking and operational improvements.

-   **Service Calls Trend and Cost Control**  showed  **35 service calls in January**, with fees introduced to discourage unnecessary truck rolls (06:30).
    
    -   Laura’s efforts have saved some calls by resolving issues remotely, reducing costs and truck roll frequency.
        
    -   The team plans to track service calls weekly and monthly with detailed breakdowns to analyze causes and trends for better resource allocation.
        
    -   Kevin Rose noted that fewer service calls may reflect lower customer counts rather than improved service, requiring deeper analysis.
        
-   **Vehicle Idle Time Monitoring**  to reduce fuel costs and maintenance (10:34).
    
    -   Management requested techs reduce idle time during service calls and installs to prevent early vehicle maintenance and control expenses.
        
    -   Stanley, Chris, and Aaron were specifically asked to monitor and improve this aspect.
        
-   **Site Checks and Install Scheduling**  are streamlined to reduce wait times and improve customer onboarding (53:11).
    
    -   Site checks are done quickly and followed by installations as soon as possible, with no requirement that every Toronto install must have a prior site check.
        
    -   Stanley reported  **6 installs completed in February**  with  **8 installs and 6 site checks pending**, indicating a steady pipeline.
        
    -   Customer hesitancy about installations is addressed through educational videos and personalized outreach to ease concerns.
        

## **Sales, Marketing, and Customer Acquisition**

The team is developing realistic growth targets and marketing strategies to increase installs and customer base while competing with major providers.

-   **Install Targets and Growth Planning**  discussed with Stanley aiming to ramp up installs beyond current levels (24:47).
    
    -   Stanley has about  **15 prospects**  in the pipeline and expects to convert many pending site checks into installs, potentially reaching  **14 pending installs**  soon.
        
    -   Management wants to set clear monthly install goals, like  **8 installs per month**, and balance installs against disconnects to ensure net growth.
        
    -   A side meeting involving Stanley, TJ, and Kevin is planned to finalize targets and tactical plans.
        
-   **Marketing Approach Emphasizes Local Presence**  and cautious promotion due to contractual restrictions with Spectrum (49:00).

    -   Brittany is leading efforts on Google reviews, with  **7-8 new reviews in recent months**, helping build trust and strengthen brand presence.
        
    -   The goal is to secure at least  **5 reviews per month**  to maintain positive online reputation.
        
-   **Leveraging Service Quality and Customer Stories**  to boost sales and counter competitors (35:37).
    
    -   Kevin Rose suggested gathering customer testimonials, especially those on Toronto, to highlight superior performance versus competitors like Starlink.
        
    -   Local success stories, such as Rhonda Young switching from Spectrum, are used as proof points to attract new customers.
        
    -   The team sees opportunities from recent Spectrum outages and customer dissatisfaction to convert those customers.
        
-   **Customer Count and Market Size Clarification**  requested for 2026 planning (51:25).
    
    -   Kevin Rose requested a realistic forecast for customer additions in the Owen market for 2026 to inform a 10-year growth model.
        
    -   The team agreed to deliver reasonable monthly targets that reflect achievable first-year goals, reserving aggressive growth for later years.
